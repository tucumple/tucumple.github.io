                    <p><strong><h4>1. Tom Hanks is a distant relative of President Abraham Lincoln—and Mr. Rogers.</strong><br><br>

                        Hanks, who narrated National Geographic’s 2013 historical drama Killing Lincoln, boasts ancestral 
                        ties to the 16th president of the United States through Lincoln’s mother, Nancy Hanks. 
                        The four-time Golden Globe winner is a third cousin, four times removed of Lincoln’s. The former 
                        president’s great-great-grandfather was John Hanks, who was also Tom's 
                        great-great-great-great-great-great-grandfather.
                        
                        In 2019, Hanks also found out, thanks to researchers at Ancestry.com, that he shares some DNA 
                        with Mr. Rogers. “It all just comes together, you see,” Hanks teased when he learned the news 
                        from Access Hollywood.</h4>

                        President Barack Obama awarded Hanks with the honor in 2016 for not only his film work, but 
                        his social and environmental justice efforts and advocacy on behalf of veterans and their families. 
                        Ellen DeGeneres, Robert De Niro, Michael Jordan, Diana Ross, Bruce Springsteen, and Cicely Tyson 
                        also received the Presidential Medal of Freedom the same year as Hanks.</h4>

                        and You’ve Got Mail co-star Meg Ryan serves as the namesake for the 8353 Megryan and the two 
                        asteroids, discovered seven years apart in different hemispheres, had a cosmic rendezvous when
